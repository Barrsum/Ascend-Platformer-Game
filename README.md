## Overview

"Ascend" is a minimalist yet engaging platformer where the primary goal across 5 distinct levels is simple: climb up and reach the goal flag at the top. The game features:

*   A sleek, modern dark theme.
*   Progressively challenging level design.
*   A life system (3 lives for the entire game).
*   Basic physics (gravity, jumping, movement).
*   Compatibility with both keyboard (Arrows/WASD + Space) and touch controls (virtual joystick + jump button).
*   Responsive scaling to fit various screen sizes, aiming for edge-to-edge width on mobile.
*   A pause menu with options to resume, view controls, or return to the main menu.

The development heavily utilized "Vibe Coding" principles, using AI as a partner to generate code snippets, brainstorm solutions, debug issues, and iterate on features quickly.

## Features

*   **5 Unique Levels:** Carefully designed levels with increasing difficulty.
*   **Core Platformer Mechanics:** Smooth player movement, jumping, and gravity simulation.
*   **Responsive Scaling:** Game area scales uniformly to fit the available screen space, prioritizing width on mobile.
*   **Dual Control Schemes:**
    *   **Keyboard:** Arrow keys or WASD for movement, Spacebar/W/Up Arrow for jumping. Escape/P for pause.
    *   **Touch:** On-screen virtual joystick for movement and a dedicated jump button.
*   **Life System:** Players have 3 lives; falling off platforms costs a life and restarts the current level.
*   **Pause Functionality:** In-game pause menu accessible via button or keyboard shortcut (Esc/P).
*   **How to Play Modal:** Accessible from Home Screen and Pause Menu.
*   **Win/Game Over Screens:** Clear feedback upon completing all levels or running out of lives.
*   **Fixed Header & Footer:** Provides consistent UI elements including game title, creator credit, and social links.
*   **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with React, Vite, and modern CSS.
*   **AI Collaboration:** Developed with significant assistance from AI for code generation, debugging, and feature implementation, embodying the #VibeCoding challenge spirit.
